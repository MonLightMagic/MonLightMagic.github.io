## Ongoing Project

- **A review paper on semantic communication and AIGC**

With the rapid development of information technology, traditional communication methods and content generation modes have been difficult to meet the needs of modern society for efficient and intelligent information interaction. As a new communication paradigm, **semantic communication** emphasizes the shift from bit transmission to semantic understanding, which can effectively **improve the efficiency and quality of information transmission**. And AIGC, with its powerful semantic understanding and generation capability, provides richer information sources and smarter processing means for semantic communication. **The combination of the two can not only satisfy the user's demand for high-quality experience, but also promote the deep integration of artificial intelligence and communication technology, adapt to complex and diverse application scenarios, and enhance the security and reliability of information transmission.** Therefore, in-depth research on the integration of semantic communication and AIGC has important practical significance and broad application prospects, and has a far-reaching impact on the construction of smarter, more efficient and safer communication systems.

## Degree Thesis

- Design and Implementation of an Integrated Semantic Communication System for Multitasking and Multimodality（面向多任务多模态的一体化语义通信系统的设计和实现）<br>**Yuyang Zhang** (Advisor: Ke Xiong). <br>

  With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, a large number of intelligent applications emerge and require large-scale connectivity and information transmission on limited wireless resources, which brings significant challenges to traditional communication systems. **Semantic communication**, as an emerging communication technology, improves the communication performance by extracting task-related semantic information, especially in undesirable channel environments. With the combination of deep learning and communication technology, it has become possible to extract semantic information from source data using deep neural networks, but the existing methods face difficulties in model updating and limited storage resources when dealing with multi-task and multi-modal data. Therefore, the aim of this project is to investigate and **design a unified multi-task semantic communication system** to simultaneously process multiple tasks and multi-modal data to improve communication efficiency and performance through an end-to-end deep learning framework to meet the requirements of modern wireless communication networks.
